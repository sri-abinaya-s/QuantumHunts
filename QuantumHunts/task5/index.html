            <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
            <h2>2006</h2>
            <p>Swift's debut album dropped when she was a mere teenager, and it illustrated her early country music influences in a way that would make it nearly unrecognizable to her modern hits. Singles like "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Tim McGraw" were seminal songs in the rising country pop genre, and the album continued to produce singles all the way into 2008.</p>

            <h1>Red</h1>
            <h2>2012</h2>
            <p>Though many tried to make Swift's country pop image stick, 2012's Red represented the singer/songwriter's final push towards mainstream radio pop. Generally considered one of Taylor Swift's more naughty albums, she clearly broadened her horizons in the songwriting process and stripped away the cutesy naïveté that dominated her first three records. Boisterous anthems like "I Knew You Were Trouble", "22", and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" completely transformed her sound. </p>

            <h1>1989</h1>
            <h2>2014</h2>
            <p>If questions lingered about where Taylor Swift stood regarding country music after Red, the debut single from 1989 was a definitive answer. Pop anthems like "Shake It Off" and "Bad Blood" were certified radio juggernauts without a hint of the twang that had carried swift for her first few albums. By 1989, Swift's personal life began to dominate the discourse regarding her music, and her distinct songwriting style fueled the celebrity gossip flames. Despite winning Album of the Year, 1989 divided critics with some criticizing her overt attempts to be commercial (via Slant). Regardless, Swift had finally come into her own as the new Queen of Pop.</p>

            <h1>Reputation</h1>
            <h2>2017</h2>
            <p>Continuing Swift's somewhat divisive era from a critical standpoint, 2017's Reputation didn't struggle to pull in the cash financially, and it produced a slew of singles. After the bubblegum synthpop of 1989, Taylor Swift presented a noticeably darker version of herself on Reputation that was likely informed by Swift's feud with the Kardashians and Kanye West. On top of that, with the media picking apart every part of her personal relationships, songs like "Look What You Made Me Do" had added meaning. Reputation was Swifts fourth consecutive album to debut at the top of the US Billboard 200.</p>

            <h1>Lover</h1>
            <h2>2019</h2>
            <p>Coming as her first album to be released following her departure from Big Machine Records, 2019's Lover showed off a Taylor Swift who could look backward for the first time. Reincorporating earlier influences, Lover was a step back from her rising pop queen status and showed a happier and healthy artist in general. Singles like "You Need To Calm Down" poked fun at her critics, but the album was obviously intended to be a more subdued release compared to her previous few records. While previous albums had clear hip hop and R&B influences, Lover showed Swift setting her sights on rock and indie.</p>

            <p>Released right on the heels of her suprise album, folklore, Swifts second album of 2020 was a continuation of her work with Dessner. The stripped down evermore continued her cinematic approach to storytelling and even brought in The National to back her up on the single "Coney Island" and perennial indie favorites Haim on "No Body, No Crime". The album debuted at number one, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.</p>

            <h2>2022</h2>
            <p>Taking a break from reviving her old standards, Taylor Swift released 2022's Midnights, a moody and introspective concept album that continued the trends in her previous two studio efforts. "Anti-home" offered a side of Swift which had never been seen before, and the Queen of Pop looked vulnerable and human as she took inspiration from the rising popularity of moody bedroom pop artists. Despite lacking the same radio-friendliness of her earlier records, Midnights proved to be Swift's best-selling album so far (via CNBC) and was further proof of her untouchable status.</p>

            <p>In the middle of her record-breaking Eras tour, Taylor Swift announced that her next Taylor's Version record is going to be her pop-oriented classic 1989 which was released in October 2023, the album promises to be even bigger and grander than previous Taylor's Version releases. With so much more at her disposal, Swift has a chance to recontextualize her bubblegum pop era into something more meaningful, and subtly tweak the recordings of some of her most popular songs.</p>
